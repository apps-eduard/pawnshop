# Auction Sales in Recent Transactions - Implementation

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE  
**Issue:** Auction sales transactions were not appearing in the Cashier Dashboard's "Recent Transactions" section

## Problem

When processing auction sales (selling items to buyers), these sales were not visible in the "Recent Transactions" section of the Cashier Dashboard. This was because:

1. **Auction sales don't create transaction records** - They only update the `pawn_items` table with sale information
2. **Recent Transactions query only looked at `transactions` table** - It completely missed auction sales

## Solution

Modified the **GET `/api/transactions`** endpoint to also fetch recent auction sales from `pawn_items` table and merge them with regular transactions.

### Backend Changes

**File:** `pawn-api/routes/transactions.js`

#### 1. Added Auction Sales Query (Lines ~490-525)

```javascript
// **ALSO FETCH RECENT AUCTION SALES** (only for recent transactions, not filtered)
let auctionSales = [];
if (!search && !type && !status && !dateFrom && !dateTo) {
  // Only include auction sales when showing all recent transactions (no filters)
  const salesResult = await pool.query(`
    SELECT 
      pi.id,
      pi.sold_date as transaction_date,
      pi.sold_date as created_at,
      pi.sold_date as updated_at,
      pi.final_price,
      pi.discount_amount,
      pi.auction_price,
      pi.sale_notes,
      p.id as buyer_id,
      p.first_name,
      p.last_name,
      p.mobile_number,
      p.email,
      cat.name as category_name,
      d.name as description_name,
      pi.appraised_value,
      t.principal_amount as loan_amount,
      e.first_name as cashier_first_name,
      e.last_name as cashier_last_name,
      br.name as branch_name
    FROM pawn_items pi
    JOIN pawners p ON pi.buyer_id = p.id
    LEFT JOIN categories cat ON pi.category_id = cat.id
    LEFT JOIN descriptions d ON pi.description_id = d.id
    LEFT JOIN transactions t ON pi.transaction_id = t.id
    LEFT JOIN employees e ON t.created_by = e.id
    LEFT JOIN branches br ON t.branch_id = br.id
    WHERE pi.status = 'sold' 
      AND pi.sold_date IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY pi.sold_date DESC, pi.id DESC
    LIMIT 10
  `);
  
  auctionSales = salesResult.rows;
  console.log(`âœ… Found ${auctionSales.length} auction sales`);
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Only fetches auction sales when no filters are applied (showing recent transactions)
- Gets cashier info from the original transaction (`t.created_by`)
- Gets branch info from transaction's branch

#### 2. Map Auction Sales to Transaction Format (Lines ~640-710)

```javascript
// Map auction sales to transaction format
const auctionSaleTransactions = auctionSales.map(sale => ({
  id: `AS-${sale.id}`, // Prefix to distinguish from regular transactions
  // Transaction type specific to auction sales
  ticket_number: `SALE-${sale.id}`,
  transaction_type: 'auction_sale',
  transactionType: 'auction_sale',
  principal_amount: parseFloat(sale.loan_amount || 0),
  total_amount: parseFloat(sale.final_price || 0),
  finalPrice: parseFloat(sale.final_price || 0),
  auctionPrice: parseFloat(sale.auction_price || 0),
  discountAmount: parseFloat(sale.discount_amount || 0),
  status: 'completed',
  createdAt: sale.created_at,
  updatedAt: sale.updated_at,
  // Buyer information (using pawner fields for consistency)
  pawnerName: `${sale.first_name} ${sale.last_name}`,
  pawnerContact: sale.mobile_number,
  // Cashier information
  cashierName: `${sale.cashier_first_name || ''} ${sale.cashier_last_name || ''}`.trim(),
  // Branch information
  branchName: sale.branch_name || 'N/A',
  // Item information
  items: [{
    id: sale.id,
    categoryName: sale.category_name,
    descriptionName: sale.description_name,
    appraisedValue: sale.appraised_value,
    loanAmount: sale.loan_amount,
    status: 'sold'
  }],
  notes: sale.sale_notes,
  transactionHistory: []
}));
```

#### 3. Combine and Sort Results (Lines ~710-715)

```javascript
// Combine and sort by date (most recent first)
const allTransactions = [...transactions, ...auctionSaleTransactions]
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt) - new Date(a.createdAt))
  .slice(0, parseInt(limit)); // Respect limit
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Added Transaction Type Label (cashier-dashboard.ts)

```typescript
getTransactionTypeLabel(type: string): string {
  const typeMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    new_loan: 'New Loan',
    payment: 'Payment',
    renewal: 'Renewal',
    redemption: 'Redemption',
    auction_sale: 'Auction Sale'  // âœ… NEW
  };

  return typeMap[type] || type;
}
```

#### 2. Added Transaction Type Color (status-color.service.ts)

```typescript
private readonly transactionTypeColors: { [key: string]: string } = {
  // ... other colors
  'auction': 'bg-amber-100 text-amber-800 dark:bg-amber-900 dark:text-amber-200...',
  'auction_sale': 'bg-amber-100 text-amber-800 dark:bg-amber-900 dark:text-amber-200...',  // âœ… NEW
};
```

## Transaction ID Format

**Regular Transactions:** `TXN-202510-000001` (from `transactions` table)  
**Auction Sales:** `SALE-123` (prefixed with sale ID from `pawn_items` table)

This distinction helps identify auction sales at a glance.

## Data Flow

### Before Fix:
```
Cashier Dashboard
    â†“
GET /api/transactions
    â†“
Query: transactions table only
    â†“
Result: New loans, renewals, redemptions
    âœ— Missing: Auction sales
```

### After Fix:
```
Cashier Dashboard
    â†“
GET /api/transactions
    â†“
Query 1: transactions table (regular transactions)
Query 2: pawn_items table (auction sales where status='sold')
    â†“
Merge & Sort by date
    â†“
Result: New loans, renewals, redemptions, auction sales âœ“
```

## Display Format

Auction sales now appear in Recent Transactions with:

- **Badge:** "Auction Sale" (amber/yellow color)
- **Ticket Number:** `SALE-{id}` format
- **Customer Name:** Buyer's name
- **Amount:** Final sale price (after discount)
- **Status:** Completed
- **Item Info:** Single item that was sold

## Testing

1. âœ… Create an auction sale from Auction Items page
2. âœ… Navigate to Cashier Dashboard
3. âœ… Verify auction sale appears in "Recent Transactions"
4. âœ… Verify it shows correct buyer name, amount, and date
5. âœ… Verify badge shows "Auction Sale" in amber color

## Files Modified

### Backend (1 file):
- `pawn-api/routes/transactions.js` - Added auction sales query and mapping

### Frontend (2 files):
- `pawn-web/src/app/features/dashboards/cashier-dashboard/cashier-dashboard.ts` - Added auction_sale label
- `pawn-web/src/app/core/services/status-color.service.ts` - Added auction_sale color

## Notes

- Auction sales only appear when **no filters** are applied (showing recent transactions)
- When filtering by type, status, date, or search - only regular transactions are shown
- This is intentional to keep the filter logic simple
- Auction sales can be viewed in detail in the Auction Items or Sales Reports pages

## Related Issues Fixed

- âœ… Auction sales now visible in Recent Transactions
- âœ… Cashier can see all recent activity including auction sales
- âœ… Consistent transaction display across dashboard

## Future Enhancements

Consider creating actual `transaction` records for auction sales to:
1. Simplify querying and reporting
2. Include auction sales in filtered results
3. Maintain complete transaction history in one table
4. Enable easier auditing and tracking

---

**Result:** Cashiers can now see auction sales in their Recent Transactions section! ðŸŽ‰
