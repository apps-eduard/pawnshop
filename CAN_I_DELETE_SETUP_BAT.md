# Quick Answer: Can I Delete setup.bat?

## 📌 Short Answer

**No, it's recommended to keep both `setup.bat` and `setup.ps1`**

But if you must choose one, keep what works for you!

## 🎯 What's Available Now

You have **3 setup options**:

### 1. **run-setup.cmd** ⭐ (NEW - EASIEST)
- **Just double-click it!**
- Runs PowerShell script properly
- Window stays open
- **This is the easiest way!**

### 2. **setup.bat** (Traditional)
- Double-click to run
- Works on all Windows
- Well-tested
- Keep this if you prefer batch files

### 3. **setup.ps1** (Modern PowerShell)
- Run from PowerShell terminal: `.\setup.ps1`
- Modern features
- Better messages about penalty & service charges
- Don't double-click this directly (use run-setup.cmd instead)

---

## ✅ Recommendation

**Use `run-setup.cmd`** - Just double-click it!

This is the new file I created that:
- ✅ Easy to use (double-click)
- ✅ Runs the modern PowerShell script
- ✅ Window stays open
- ✅ Shows all the seeding details
- ✅ No command line needed

---

## 🔧 Why Keep Both?

- **setup.bat** - Some users prefer batch files, maximum compatibility
- **setup.ps1** - Modern features, better error handling, detailed messages
- **run-setup.cmd** - Easy launcher that makes PowerShell script easy to run

Having all three gives everyone options!
