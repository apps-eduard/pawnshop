# Renew UX Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the Renew transaction page with improved user experience:
1. Auto-focus on "Received Amount" after successful search
2. Set change to 0 when received amount is empty or 0
3. Confirmed search icon has no tabindex (already clean)

## Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Component (`renew.ts`)

#### Added ViewChild for Received Amount Input
```typescript
@ViewChild('receivedAmountInput') receivedAmountInput?: ElementRef<HTMLInputElement>;
```

#### Auto-Focus After Successful Search
```typescript
if (result.success && result.data) {
  this.populateForm(result.data);
  this.transactionFound = true;
  
  // Set focus to received amount input after successful search
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.receivedAmountInput?.nativeElement.focus();
  }, 100);
}
```

**Why:** After searching for a transaction, the cursor automatically moves to the "Received Amount" field, allowing the cashier to immediately start entering the payment amount without clicking.

#### Improved Change Calculation
```typescript
calculateChange() {
  // Set change to 0 if received amount is empty or 0
  if (!this.renewComputation.receivedAmount || this.renewComputation.receivedAmount === 0) {
    this.renewComputation.change = 0;
    return;
  }
  
  this.renewComputation.change = this.renewComputation.receivedAmount - this.renewComputation.totalRenewAmount;
}
```

**Why:** Prevents showing negative change when the field is empty. Now displays "₱0.00" instead of a negative amount when no payment is entered.

### 2. HTML Template (`renew.html`)

#### Added Template Reference to Received Amount Input
```html
<input #receivedAmountInput type="text" appCurrencyInput [minValue]="0" 
  (valueChange)="renewComputation.receivedAmount = $event; calculateChange()"
  class="w-[65%] px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 bg-white dark:bg-slate-600 border border-slate-300 dark:border-slate-500 rounded focus:outline-none focus:ring-1 focus:ring-slate-500 text-right"
  placeholder="₱ 0.00">
```

**Why:** The `#receivedAmountInput` template reference allows the TypeScript component to access and focus this input element programmatically.

#### Search Icon Button
The search icon button already has no `tabindex` attribute, which is correct. Buttons are naturally focusable with tab navigation, so no explicit tabindex is needed.

## User Experience Flow

### Before Changes:
1. User searches for transaction ✅
2. Transaction loads successfully ✅
3. User must click on "Received Amount" field manually ❌
4. Empty received amount shows negative change ❌

### After Changes:
1. User searches for transaction ✅
2. Transaction loads successfully ✅
3. **Cursor automatically moves to "Received Amount" field** ✅
4. **Empty field shows ₱0.00 change instead of negative** ✅
5. User can immediately type the payment amount ✅

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Search for a transaction by ticket number
- [x] Verify focus automatically moves to "Received Amount" input
- [x] Verify change shows ₱0.00 when received amount is empty
- [x] Verify change shows ₱0.00 when received amount is 0
- [x] Verify change calculates correctly when amount is entered
- [x] Verify tab navigation works properly (no tabindex on search icon)

## Benefits

1. **Faster Data Entry:** Cashier doesn't need to click after search
2. **Better UX:** Natural flow from search → enter payment amount
3. **Clean Display:** No confusing negative change amounts
4. **Keyboard Friendly:** Tab navigation works as expected

## Related Components

These same improvements can be applied to:
- Partial Payment page
- Redeem page
- Additional Loan page

All transaction pages with "Received Amount" or similar payment input fields would benefit from this auto-focus pattern.
