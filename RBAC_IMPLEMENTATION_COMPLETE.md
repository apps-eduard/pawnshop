## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as administrator
- [ ] Navigate to RBAC page via sidebar
- [ ] View all users in Users tab
- [ ] Change a user's role (test with different roles)
- [ ] Deactivate a user
- [ ] Activate a user
- [ ] View Roles Overview tab (verify user counts)
- [ ] View Permissions Matrix tab (verify checkmarks)
- [ ] Test as manager (should see RBAC but not be able to change roles)
- [ ] Test that other roles cannot access RBAC page

## API Server Status

‚úÖ Server running on port 3000
‚úÖ RBAC routes loaded and accessible
‚úÖ Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/health

## Next Steps

1. Test the RBAC functionality in the browser
2. Verify role changes persist in database
3. Test menu visibility changes when roles are changed
4. Consider adding:
   - Bulk role assignments
   - Role creation/deletion (currently fixed roles)
   - Audit log for role changes
   - User search/filter functionality
   - Export user list functionality

## Notes

- All role changes require confirmation to prevent accidental changes
- Inactive users cannot login but their data is preserved
- Only administrators can change user roles (security measure)
- Managers can view all information but have limited modification rights
- The system uses the existing `employees` table with `role` and `is_active` columns
