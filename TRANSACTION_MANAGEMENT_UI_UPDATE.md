# Transaction Management UI Update

## Summary
Updated the transaction management component to improve user interaction by separating the collapse/expand functionality from the computation details view. Added eye icons to transaction history entries for viewing their computation details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Transaction Number - Toggle Collapse
**Location:** Transaction table row - Transaction Number column

**Previous Behavior:**
- Transaction number was static text
- Eye icon toggled the transaction history collapse

**New Behavior:**
- **Transaction number is now clickable** and toggles the transaction history collapse
- Shows a chevron down (‚ñº) icon when collapsed
- Shows a chevron up (‚ñ≤) icon when expanded
- Hover effect changes text color to primary blue
- Cursor changes to pointer on hover
- Tooltip indicates "Show/Hide Transaction History"

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive - clicking the item itself expands/collapses it
- Follows common UI patterns (e.g., accordion, dropdowns)
- Larger clickable area for better usability

### 2. Eye Icon - View Computation Details (Main Transaction)
**Location:** Actions column in transaction table row

**Previous Behavior:**
- Eye icon toggled transaction history collapse
- Eye icon changed to "eye-off" when expanded

**New Behavior:**
- **Eye icon opens a modal** showing transaction computation details
- Always shows the same eye icon (doesn't change)
- Modal displays comprehensive transaction information:
  - Transaction number, type, status, customer name
  - Computation breakdown (principal, interest/service charge, total, balance)
  - Date information (loan date, maturity date)
  - Visual note about viewing transaction history

**Benefits:**
- Dedicated view for computation details
- Better separation of concerns
- More detailed information presentation
- Non-intrusive (modal can be easily dismissed)

### 3. Eye Icon - View History Computation Details (NEW)
**Location:** Transaction History entries (within expanded transaction)

**New Feature:**
- **Each transaction history entry now has an eye icon** on the right side
- Clicking the eye icon opens a modal showing that specific history entry's computation details
- Modal displays:
  - Parent transaction information (ticket number, customer)
  - History transaction information (transaction number, type, status, date)
  - Computation breakdown (principal amount, amount paid, balance after transaction)
  - Notes (if any)
  - Additional metadata (created time, created date)

**Benefits:**
- Quick access to detailed computation for each payment/transaction
- Especially useful for partial payments to see what was paid and remaining balance
- Clear separation between parent transaction and history entry details
- Maintains context by showing parent transaction info

**Examples:**
- View partial payment details: See how much was paid and remaining balance
- View renewal details: See the computation for a renewal transaction
- View redemption details: See final payment and closure information

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **transaction-management.html**
   - Updated transaction number cell with click handler and chevron icons
   - Changed eye icon button in Actions column to call `viewComputationDetails()`
   - Added eye icon to each transaction history entry to call `viewHistoryComputationDetails()`
   - Added computation details modal with two display modes:
     - Main transaction computation view
     - Transaction history entry computation view
   - Enhanced transaction history entries with hover effects

2. **transaction-management.ts**
   - Added `showComputationModal` property (boolean)
   - Added `selectedTransaction` property (Transaction | null)
   - Added `selectedHistory` property (any) - for viewing history entry details
   - Added `isViewingHistory` property (boolean) - flag to distinguish between main and history views
   - Added `viewComputationDetails()` method - opens modal for main transaction
   - Added `viewHistoryComputationDetails()` method - opens modal for history entry
   - Updated `closeComputationModal()` method to reset all modal-related properties

### Modal Features
- Full-screen overlay with semi-transparent background
- Centered, responsive modal (11/12 width on mobile, 3/4 on medium, 1/2 on large screens)
- Click outside to close functionality
- Close button in header
- Organized sections with cards:
  - Transaction Information
  - Computation Breakdown
  - Date Information
  - Additional Note

### Styling
- Dark mode support throughout
- Consistent with existing design system
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Accessibility-friendly with proper color contrast

## User Experience Flow

### Expanding Transaction History
1. User clicks on transaction number
2. Row expands to show transaction history inline
3. Chevron icon changes from down to up
4. Click again to collapse

### Viewing Computation Details (Main Transaction)
1. User clicks eye icon in Actions column
2. Modal overlay appears with computation details
3. User can review all transaction computations
4. User closes modal by:
   - Clicking "Close" button
   - Clicking outside the modal
   - Clicking X button in header

### Viewing Computation Details (History Entry)
1. User expands transaction history by clicking transaction number
2. User locates the specific history entry they want to view (e.g., partial payment)
3. User clicks the eye icon on the right side of that history entry
4. Modal overlay appears showing:
   - Parent transaction context
   - Specific history entry computation details
   - Amount paid, balance, and other relevant information
5. User closes modal using any of the close methods

**Example Scenario:**
```
Transaction: TXN-202510-000001
‚îú‚îÄ Main eye icon ‚Üí Shows overall loan computation
‚îî‚îÄ Transaction History (expanded)
   ‚îú‚îÄ TXN-202510-000002 (Partial Payment) üëÅÔ∏è ‚Üí Shows partial payment details
   ‚îú‚îÄ TXN-202510-000003 (Partial Payment) üëÅÔ∏è ‚Üí Shows partial payment details
   ‚îî‚îÄ TXN-202510-000004 (Redemption) üëÅÔ∏è ‚Üí Shows redemption details
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functionality Tests:**
   - Click transaction number to expand/collapse history
   - Click eye icon to open computation modal
   - Verify modal shows correct transaction data
   - Test close modal functionality (button, outside click, X button)

2. **Responsive Tests:**
   - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes
   - Verify modal responsiveness
   - Check hover states on desktop

3. **Dark Mode Tests:**
   - Verify all elements look good in dark mode
   - Check contrast ratios

4. **Accessibility Tests:**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Focus management

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add loading state when fetching computation details
2. Add "Print" or "Export" button in computation modal
3. Include more detailed breakdown (e.g., penalty charges, service charges)
4. Add ability to view/edit transaction from the modal
5. Show payment schedule if available

## Notes

- The computation modal currently shows basic calculations
- For detailed payment history, users should expand the transaction history by clicking the transaction number
- All existing functionality remains intact
- No breaking changes to the API or data structure
