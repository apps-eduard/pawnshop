## üéØ Pawner Dashboard - No Login Required

### Important Design Decision

**Pawners are NOT employees** - they are customers in the `pawners` table. The Pawner Dashboard is designed as a **public kiosk interface** where:

1. **No login required** - Pawners walk up to kiosk
2. **Self-search** - Enter name or mobile number
3. **Self-select** - Choose their profile from results
4. **Join queue** - Select service type and get queue number
5. **Wait** - See queue position and estimated wait time

### Access Methods

**Option 1: Direct URL Access (Recommended)**
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:4200/dashboard/pawner`
- No authentication needed
- Full self-service queue functionality

**Option 2: Kiosk Mode**
- Deploy on tablet/touchscreen at entrance
- Auto-start browser in kiosk mode pointing to pawner dashboard
- Customers can't navigate away from queue interface

### Security Considerations

‚úÖ **What Pawners CAN Do:**
- Search for their own information (public data)
- Join queue with their selected profile
- View their own queue status
- Leave queue before being called

‚ùå **What Pawners CANNOT Do:**
- View other pawners' information
- Access employee dashboards
- Process transactions
- View reports or sensitive data
- Modify system settings

### Staff Workflow Integration

Once queue system is complete:

1. **Pawner Self-Service:**
   - Pawner searches ‚Üí Selects profile ‚Üí Joins queue
   - Gets queue number (e.g., Q001)

2. **Staff Dashboard (Cashier/Appraiser):**
   - Sees waiting queue list
   - Clicks pawner to auto-fill transaction form
   - Processes service
   - Queue status auto-updates to "processing" ‚Üí "completed"

## üìã Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Update Cashier Dashboard**
   - Add queue widget showing waiting pawners
   - Add click-to-auto-fill functionality for transaction forms
   - Update queue status when processing starts

2. **Update Appraiser Dashboard**
   - Add queue widget showing waiting pawners for appraisal
   - Add click-to-auto-fill functionality for appraisal forms
   - Update queue status when appraisal starts

3. **Testing & Integration**
   - Test complete workflow: pawner joins ‚Üí staff processes ‚Üí queue completes
   - Verify auto-fill functionality works correctly
   - Test queue status transitions
   - Verify "Old Pawner" vs "New Pawner" badges display correctly
