# Eye Icon Enhancement - Invoice Reprint Functionality

## Overview
Enhanced the eye icon functionality in Transaction Management to clearly indicate that it opens an invoice/receipt that can be reprinted. Updated tooltips and modal titles to make the purpose more obvious to users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Eye Icon Tooltip - Main Transaction
**Location:** Actions column in transaction table

**Before:**
```html
title="View Computation Details"
```

**After:**
```html
title="View Invoice / Print Receipt"
```

**Purpose:**
- Makes it clear the eye icon opens an invoice
- Indicates printing capability
- Encourages reprint functionality

### 2. Updated Eye Icon Tooltip - Transaction History
**Location:** Transaction history entries (when expanded)

**Before:**
```html
title="View Computation Details"
```

**After:**
```html
title="View Receipt / Print Invoice"
```

**Purpose:**
- Consistent with main transaction tooltip
- Emphasizes receipt/invoice nature
- Makes reprint option obvious

### 3. Updated Modal Title
**Location:** Modal header

**Before:**
```html
{{ isViewingHistory ? 'Transaction History' : 'Transaction' }} Computation Details
```

**After:**
```html
{{ isViewingHistory ? 'Payment Receipt' : 'Transaction Invoice' }}
```

**Purpose:**
- Clearer terminology (Invoice vs Receipt)
- Main transaction = "Transaction Invoice"
- History entry = "Payment Receipt"
- More professional terminology
